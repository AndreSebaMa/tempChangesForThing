# Djanbee Command Structure

## What is a Command?

A command in Djanbee is a high-level operation that users can execute through the CLI. Each command serves as a coordinator that:

1. Orchestrates multiple operations to complete a specific task
2. Delegates detailed implementation to specialized managers
3. Contains minimal business logic
4. Provides a clear map of what functionality is available

Commands are designed to be thin layers that connect user intentions to the appropriate managers.

## Command Components

All commands follow a consistent three-part structure:

1. **Manager**: Coordinates the workflow and delegates to specialized managers
2. **Display**: Handles user interaction and visual presentation
3. **Container**: Wires dependencies and exposes functionality to the CLI

## The Container as Facade

Each command uses a container that implements the **Facade pattern**. The container:

- Hides the complexity of component creation and wiring
- Exposes a simplified interface to the CLI
- Acts as the main entry point for all command functionality
- Provides properly configured instances of managers and displays

**Important**: All functions that need to be exposed to the CLI are exposed through the container. This ensures that the CLI only needs to interact with the container, not with the individual components.

## Command Organization

Commands use several established design patterns:

1. **Dependency Injection**: Managers receive their dependencies rather than creating them
2. **Facade Pattern**: Containers provide a simplified interface to complex subsystems
3. **Command Pattern**: Each command encapsulates a request as an object
4. **Mediator Pattern**: Command managers coordinate between different components

## Manager Responsibilities

The command manager follows the **Mediator pattern** by:

1. Coordinating between different specialized managers
2. Controlling the sequence of operations
3. Delegating specific tasks to appropriate managers
4. Handling errors and coordinating recovery

Command managers should NOT implement detailed business logic. Instead, they should:
- Map high-level operations to specialized manager calls
- Maintain the workflow between different operations
- Pass data between different managers as needed

## Display Responsibilities

The display component follows the **Single Responsibility Principle** by focusing exclusively on:

1. Rendering information to the user
2. Collecting user input through widgets
3. Providing feedback on operations
4. Formatting data for presentation

Display classes should contain no business logic whatsoever.

## How Commands Use Managers

Commands interact with managers through a clear hierarchy:

1. Command containers create and configure command managers
2. Command managers use application managers (injected via the container)
3. Application managers handle specific domains (OS, Django, Database, etc.)

This structure implements the **Layers pattern**, where each layer only communicates with adjacent layers.

## Implementation Example

When a user runs a command like `djanbee deploy`:

1. The CLI infrastructure locates the DeployContainer
2. The container creates properly configured Display and Manager instances
3. The manager orchestrates the deployment process by:
   - Using ServerManager to configure the web server
   - Using SocketManager to set up the socket service
   - Using DjangoManager to update Django settings
4. The display presents progress and collects any required input

Each component stays focused on its specific responsibility, creating a maintainable structure.

## Benefits of This Structure

This command organization provides several advantages:

1. **Clear responsibilities**: Each component has a well-defined role
2. **Simplified testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Consistent structure**: All commands follow the same pattern
4. **Extensibility**: New commands can be added without changing existing code
5. **Separation of concerns**: UI logic is separated from business logic

By using established design patterns and clear responsibility boundaries, Djanbee maintains a clean, maintainable command structure.
